| Category | Grade (0-3) | Comments / Justification |
|---|---|---|
| 1. **Don't make me think:** How intuitive was this site? | 1  |  This website pulls more of an effort from the user where they have to read really closely on what is provided. |
| 2. **Users are busy:** Did this site value your time?  | 2 |  This website doesn't take long to process things because all is needed is an upload of the resume but it also doesn't have an beneficial tips like Indeed. |
| 3. **Good billboard design:** Did this site make the important steps and information clear? How or how not? |  2 | Simplyhired made only one step which was upload the resume and that's it. It was clear but they didn't offer anything else to help the applicant.  |
| 4. **Tell me what to do:** Did this site lead you towards a specific, opinionated path? | 2 |  This site was overwhelming because it wasn't as simple to find what specifically was needed. They didn't give an option to search for stay at home jobs or remote option. But it was able to give specific job names similar to ones that are searched. |
| 5. **Omit Words:** How careful was this site with its use of copy? |  2 |   |
| 6. **Navigation:** How effective was the workflow / navigation of the site? | 1  | This site wasn't really effective because of how much was needed to be read in order to navigate through what you wanted to find.  |
